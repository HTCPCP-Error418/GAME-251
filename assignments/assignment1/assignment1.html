		<h2>Assignment Prompt Summary</h2>
		<p>
			Applying what you've learned is an important part of game design, both for making your
			ideas real and having someone test out your design. Play testing helps show where the
			game weak spots might be. With this in mind, we're going design a game prototype for
			each module to help your game come to life.

			Create a pitch for that person about a game by doing at least the following:

			<ol>
				<li>
					Tell us the game name.
				</li>
				<li>
					Explain the chosen game dynamic.
				</li>
				<li>
					Describe what you think the team should know about the game in text.
				</li>
				<li>
					Visually design some element about the game, be it a logo, character, level
					layout, sample puzzle, etc. Take a picture/screenshot of the visual element
					you created to represent the game.
				</li>
			</ol>
