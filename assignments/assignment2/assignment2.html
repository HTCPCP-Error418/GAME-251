		<h2>Assignment Prompt Summary</h2>
		<p>
			For this exercise, you will focus on the exploration dynamic. First, consider how it is
			used in MMOs, adventure games, and RPGs. In some adventure games, the "explore every
			location" dynamic is the whole of play. Consider how it is used in board games such as
			Clue.You are tasked with creating a game that two to four individuals can play. Since
			the game involves exploration, it needs some kind of space to explore, even if that
			space isn't a physical one. You may use this dynamic in conjunction with another. It
			will be up to you to determine the theme, mechanics, components, and additional
			dynamics, if any, for this exercise.

			Describe the following based on your selection. Include a textual description and
			create some type of visual:

			<ol>
				<li>
					What is the theme and goal of your idea?
				</li>
				<li>
					What format is the game? (e.g., board game, video game, etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Identify mechanics of the game you are creating.
				</li>
				<li>
					Identify the avatars/players. (How are players represented? Are they?)
				</li>
				<li>
					Identify conflict between players in the game play. (How do players interact
					with each other?)
				</li>
				<li>
					Who is the audience for this game?
				</li>
				<li>
					Why did you make those design choices?
				</li>
				<li>
					Create some type of visual - either analogly (by e.g., taking a picture of your
					drawing) or digital (a file or a screenshot of your chosen visual).
				</li>
			</ol>
