		<h2>Assignment Prompt Summary</h2>
		<p>
			Create a game played on the surface of a Rubik's Cube. Assume that there are magnetic
			pawns, representing the players, which can stick to the sides and bottom of the cube.

			You don't have to actually build a complete game, but experiment with the documentation
			needed to explain to others how your puzzle should be completed, then:

			<ol>
				<li>
					Write approximately 500 words to explain your game through a form of game
					documentation to explain this game you design to others
				</li>
				<li>
					Add at least one image/graphic that you could include in the documentation.
				</li>
			</ol>
