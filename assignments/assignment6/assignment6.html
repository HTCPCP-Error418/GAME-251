		<h2>Assignment Prompt Summary</h2>
		<p>
			Design a game that involves only twitch mechanics and luck — no strategic elements —
			using only dice as your components. You may use anywhere between five and ten dice for
			your game, and you can choose what kinds of dice from those that you have available.
			Your game should be playable in five minutes or fewer.

			Create a complete list of written rules.
